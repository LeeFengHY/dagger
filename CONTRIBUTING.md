Contributing
============

If you would like to contribute code to Dagger you can do so through GitHub by
forking the repository and sending a pull request.

When submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions
and style in order to keep the code as readable as possible.

Please make sure your code compiles by running `mvn clean verify` which will
execute both unit and integration test phases.  Additionally, consider using
http://travis-ci.org to validate your branches before you even put them into
pull requests.  All pull requests will be validated by Travis-ci in any case
and must pass before being merged.

If you are adding or modifying Dagger code and would like to add your name to
the copyright, modify the `AUTHORS` file. All files are released with the
Apache 2.0 license.

Before your code can be accepted into the project you must sign the
[Contributor License Agreement (CLA)][CLA].
